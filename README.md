# terraform-st2

This repo contains Terraform recipes for provisioning [StackStorm](https://github.com/StackStorm/st2)
test instances to various cloud and infrastructure providers. These recipes
provision the VM, then configure it with the [StackStorm Quick Install](https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/index.html#ref-one-line-install)
method. These are designed as a jumping off point to help new users get started
with StackStorm quicker. 

For other install methods check out the [StackStorm Installation documentation](https://docs.stackstorm.com/install/index.html).
